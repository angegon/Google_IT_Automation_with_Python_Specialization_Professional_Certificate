""" Comparison Operators
In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison
is made, Python returns a boolean result, or simply a True or False. 

To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 
We can also check if values are greater than or lesser than each other using > 
and <. If you try to compare data types that arenâ€™t compatible, like checking if 
a string is greater than an integer, Python will throw a TypeError. 

We can make very complex comparisons by joining statements together using logical 
operators with our comparison operators. These logical operators are and, or, and
not. When using the and operator, both sides of the statement being evaluated 
must be true for the whole statement to be true. When using the or operator,
if either side of the comparison is true, then the whole statement is true.
Lastly, the not operator simply inverts the value of the statement immediately
following it. So if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operato
in front of it, it would become False. """
